        </div>

        <div class="chapter-section">
            <h2>3.1 Equity Securities</h2>
            
            <p>Equity securities represent ownership in a company and are a fundamental component of the securities industry. Understanding their characteristics, types, and associated risks is essential for the SIE exam.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Stock</h3>
            <p>Common stock represents basic ownership in a corporation and typically includes voting rights. As an owner, common stockholders have certain rights and privileges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voting Rights</strong>: Typically one vote per share on major corporate matters such as electing the board of directors</li>
                <li><strong>Dividends</strong>: Right to receive dividends when declared by the board of directors, though dividends are not guaranteed</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidation Rights</strong>: Residual claim on assets after creditors and preferred stockholders are paid</li>
                <li><strong>Preemptive Rights</strong>: In some cases, the right to maintain proportional ownership by purchasing new shares before they're offered to the public</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept: Par Value vs. Market Value</h4>
                <p>Par value is the nominal or face value of a stock certificate as stated in the corporate charter. It has little relationship to the actual market value of the stock, which is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace. Many modern stocks are issued with very low par values (e.g., $0.01) or as "no par" stock.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Preferred Stock</h3>
            <p>Preferred stock is a hybrid security with characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Dividends</strong>: Typically pays a fixed or stated dividend that must be paid before common stock dividends</li>
                <li><strong>Preference in Liquidation</strong>: Priority over common stockholders in claims on assets during liquidation</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Voting Rights</strong>: Usually has limited or no voting rights</li>
                <li><strong>Potential for Callability</strong>: May be callable, allowing the issuer to redeem shares at a predetermined price</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Preferred stock may have additional features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cumulative</strong>: Unpaid dividends accumulate and must be paid before any common stock dividends</li>
                <li><strong>Non-cumulative</strong>: Unpaid dividends do not accumulate</li>
                <li><strong>Convertible</strong>: Can be converted into a specified number of common shares</li>
                <li><strong>Participating</strong>: Entitles holders to receive additional dividends beyond the stated rate if certain conditions are met</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Rights and Warrants</h3>
            <p>Rights and warrants are derivatives that give holders the option to purchase securities at specified prices.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Stock Rights</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short-term instruments (typically 2-4 weeks) issued to existing shareholders</li>
                <li>Allow purchase of additional shares at a discount before a new issue</li>
                <li>Protect against dilution of ownership</li>
                <li>Can be transferred or sold</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Warrants</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long-term instruments (often several years)</li>
                <li>Give the right to buy stock at a specified price (exercise price)</li>
                <li>Often issued with bonds as "sweeteners"</li>
                <li>Trade separately from the underlying security</li>
                <li>Generally have speculative value and higher risk</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)</h3>
            <p>ADRs represent ownership in the shares of foreign companies and trade on U.S. exchanges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Denominated in U.S. dollars</li>
                <li>Trade, clear, and settle like U.S. securities</li>
                <li>May represent one share, multiple shares, or a fraction of a share of the foreign company</li>
                <li>Subject to both U.S. and foreign market risks</li>
                <li>May involve currency exchange risk</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: ADR Structure</h4>
                <p>A U.S. bank purchases shares of a foreign company on its local exchange, holds them in custody, and issues ADRs to U.S. investors. If an ADR represents two foreign shares and the foreign shares trade at â‚¬50 each, with an exchange rate of â‚¬1 = $1.10, the ADR would be worth approximately $110 (2 Ã— â‚¬50 Ã— $1.10).</p>

            <h2>3.2 Debt Instruments</h2>
            
            <p>Debt instruments represent loans made by investors to issuers who promise to repay the principal with interest. Understanding the characteristics and risks of various debt securities is crucial for the SIE exam.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Characteristics of Bonds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Par Value (Face Value)</strong>: The amount the issuer promises to repay at maturity, typically $1,000 for corporate bonds</li>
                <li><strong>Coupon Rate</strong>: The annual interest rate paid on the bond's face value</li>
                <li><strong>Maturity Date</strong>: The date when the principal amount is repaid</li>
                <li><strong>Yield</strong>: The return on investment, which may differ from the coupon rate depending on the purchase price</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Quality</strong>: The issuer's ability to make timely interest and principal payments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept: Bond Pricing and Interest Rates</h4>
                <p>Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. This is because existing bonds with lower coupon rates become less attractive when new bonds are issued with higher rates, causing their market value to decline.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>U.S. Treasury Securities</h3>
            <p>Treasury securities are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Treasury Bills (T-Bills)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short-term securities with maturities of 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks</li>

                <li>Pay semiannual interest</li>
                <li>Exempt from state and local taxes</li>

                <li>Long-term securities with maturities of 20 or 30 years</li>
                <li>Pay semiannual interest</li>
                <li>Exempt from state and local taxes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Principal adjusts with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Municipal Bonds</h3>
            <p>Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments and their agencies to fund public projects.</p>
            
            <p><strong>General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuer</li>

                <li>Higher risk than GO bonds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept: Municipal Bond Tax Treatment</h4>
                <p>Interest from municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax. If the bonds are issued by the state where the investor resides, the interest may also be exempt from state and local taxes (triple tax-exempt). However, capital gains from selling municipal bonds are subject to federal taxes, and some municipal bond interest may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).</p>

                <li>May have subordinated debentures with lower priority in bankruptcy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Convertible Bonds</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be converted into a specified number of common shares</li>
                <li>Offer potential for capital appreciation if the stock price rises</li>
                <li>Typically offer lower coupon rates than non-convertible bonds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Other Debt Instruments</h3>

            <h2>3.3 Options</h2>
            
            <p>Options are derivative contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price within a specific time period.</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Option Types</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Call Options</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price</li>
                <li>Buyers are bullish on the underlying asset</li>
                <li>Sellers (writers) are neutral to bearish</li>
                <li>Buyers have limited risk (premium paid) and unlimited potential gain</li>
                <li>Sellers have limited gain (premium received) and unlimited potential risk</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Put Options</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price</li>
                <li>Buyers are bearish on the underlying asset</li>

                <h4>Key Concept: Option Premium Components</h4>
                <p>The premium of an option consists of two components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intrinsic Value</strong>: The amount by which the option is in-the-money (if any)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Value</strong>: The additional value beyond intrinsic value, reflecting the probability that the option will increase in value before expiration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As expiration approaches, time value decreases, a phenomenon known as time decay or theta.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Option Styles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>American Options</strong>: Can be exercised at any time before expiration</li>
                <li><strong>European Options</strong>: Can only be exercised at expiration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Option Strategies</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Covered Call</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Owning the underlying asset and selling a call option against it</li>
                <li>Generates income from the premium received</li>
                <li>Limits potential upside gain</li>
                <li>Provides limited downside protection (by the amount of the premium)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Protective Put</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Owning the underlying asset and buying a put option on it</li>
                <li>Acts as insurance against a decline in the asset's value</li>
                <li>Limits downside risk while maintaining upside potential</li>
                <li>Costs the premium paid for the put</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: Covered Call Strategy</h4>
                <p>An investor owns 100 shares of XYZ stock trading at $50 per share. The investor sells a call option with a strike price of $55 for a premium of $2 per share. If the stock price remains below $55 at expiration, the option expires worthless, and the investor keeps the $200 premium. If the stock price rises above $55, the investor's gain is limited to $5 per share plus the $2 premium, for a total of $7 per share.</p>

            <h3>Interest Rate Risk</h3>
            <p>Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of investments, particularly fixed-income securities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bond prices move inversely to interest rates</li>
                <li>Longer-term bonds have greater interest rate risk than shorter-term bonds</li>
                <li>Measured by duration and convexity</li>

            <h3>Credit/Default Risk</h3>
            <p>Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will fail to make timely interest or principal payments or that the value of a security will decline due to concerns about the issuer's ability to make payments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluated by credit rating agencies (S&P, Moody's, Fitch)</li>
                <li>Higher for lower-rated bonds (high-yield or "junk" bonds)</li>

                <li>Includes default risk, credit spread risk, and downgrade risk</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p>Liquidity risk is the risk that an investment cannot be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Higher for thinly traded securities and alternative investments</li>
                <li>Can result in wider bid-ask spreads</li>
                <li>May be exacerbated during market stress</li>
                <li>Can affect the ability to exit positions at desired prices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inflation Risk</h3>
            <p>Inflation risk, also called purchasing power risk, is the risk that inflation will erode the real value of investment returns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Particularly significant for fixed-income investments with fixed cash flows</li>
                <li>Can be mitigated with inflation-protected securities (TIPS) or investments that historically outpace inflation</li>
                <li>Affects the real (inflation-adjusted) return on investments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Political and Regulatory Risk</h3>
            <p>Political and regulatory risk is the risk that government actions, political events, or changes in regulations will adversely affect investments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can impact specific industries or the broader market</li>
                <li>Examples include tax law changes, trade policies, and environmental regulations</li>
                <li>May be higher in emerging markets or politically unstable regions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Currency/Foreign Exchange Risk</h3>
            <p>Currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will negatively impact the value of international investments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Affects investments denominated in foreign currencies</li>
                <li>Can enhance or detract from returns independent of the underlying investment's performance</li>
                <li>Can be hedged using currency forwards, futures, or options</li>
                <li>Relevant for ADRs, international mutual funds, and direct foreign investments</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Key Concept: Diversification and Risk Management</h4>
                <p>Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across various asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce risk. While it cannot eliminate systematic risk (market risk), it can significantly reduce unsystematic risk (company-specific or industry-specific risk). Effective diversification requires investments with low or negative correlations to each other.</p>

            <h3>Other Investment Risks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business Risk</strong>: Risk specific to a company or industry</li>
                <li><strong>Reinvestment Risk</strong>: Risk that future proceeds will have to be reinvested at lower interest rates</li>
                <li><strong>Call Risk</strong>: Risk that a bond issuer will redeem the bond before maturity</li>
                <li><strong>Prepayment Risk</strong>: Risk that borrowers will pay off debt early, particularly in mortgage-backed securities</li>
                <li><strong>Longevity Risk</strong>: Risk of outliving one's assets in retirement</li>
                <li><strong>Event Risk</strong>: Risk of an unexpected event negatively impacting investments</li>

                    <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Pays a fixed or stated dividend before common stock dividends</strong></p>
                    <p>Preferred stock typically pays a fixed or stated dividend that must be paid before any dividends are paid to common stockholders. Preferred stock usually has limited or no voting rights (not equal to common stock), has priority over common stock in liquidation (but is not the residual claim), and does not have a maturity date (unlike bonds).</p>

                    <p><strong>Correct Answer: B. Bond prices fall</strong></p>
                    <p>Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This is because new bonds are issued with higher coupon rates, making existing bonds with lower coupon rates less attractive. To compensate, the market price of existing bonds falls to provide a competitive yield to investors.</p>

                    <p>A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a specified price (the strike price) within a specific time period. A put option gives the right to sell a security. Option buyers have rights, while option sellers (writers) have obligations.</p>
