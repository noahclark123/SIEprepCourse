                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The securities industry operates within a complex regulatory framework designed to protect investors, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation. This chapter explores the key regulatory entities, agencies, and market participants that form the foundation of the U.S. securities industry.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding the roles and responsibilities of these entities is crucial for anyone working in the securities industry. As an engineering graduate transitioning to finance, you'll find that this regulatory structure provides the rules and boundaries within which financial innovation and market activities take place.</p>
                
                <p>This chapter builds upon the industry overview from Chapter 1, providing a more detailed examination of the regulatory landscape and the various participants in the securities markets.</p>

                <h2>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</h2>
                
                <h3>Purpose and Mission</h3>
                <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary federal regulatory agency overseeing the securities industry in the United States. Created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in response to the stock market crash of 1929, the SEC's mission is threefold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protect investors</strong> from fraud and other abuses</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets</strong> that facilitate capital formation</li>
                    <li><strong>Facilitate capital formation</strong> to support economic growth and job creation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Structure and Organization</h3>
                <p>The SEC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. To ensure political balance, no more than three commissioners can belong to the same political party. The President designates one of the commissioners as the Chairman, who serves as the agency's chief executive.</p>
                
                <p>The SEC is organized into five divisions and numerous offices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Division of Corporation Finance</strong>: Reviews corporate disclosures and registration statements</li>
                    <li><strong>Division of Trading and Markets</strong>: Regulates broker-dealers, securities exchanges, and other market participants</li>

                <h2>Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)</h2>
                
                <h3>Purpose and Mission of SROs</h3>
                <p>Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are non-governmental entities that have the power to create and enforce industry regulations and standards. They operate under SEC oversight and play a crucial role in regulating securities markets and market participants.</p>
                
                <p>The primary purposes of SROs include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishing and enforcing rules for their members</li>
                    <li>Promoting ethical business practices</li>
                    <li>Protecting investors and the public interest</li>
                    <li>Providing a mechanism for industry self-regulation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</h3>
                <p>FINRA is the largest SRO overseeing broker-dealers in the United States. Formed in 2007 through the merger of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), FINRA is responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Registering and examining broker-dealers and their associated persons</li>
                    <li>Writing and enforcing rules governing broker-dealer conduct</li>
                    <li>Administering qualification examinations, including the SIE exam</li>
                    <li>Operating the Central Registration Depository (CRD) system</li>
                    <li>Providing market surveillance and trade reporting facilities</li>
                    <li>Administering dispute resolution forums for investors and industry disputes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>FINRA's authority extends to all broker-dealers doing business with the public in the U.S. It has the power to fine, suspend, or expel firms and individuals for violations of its rules.</p>
                
                <h3>Other SROs</h3>
                <p>In addition to FINRA, other important SROs include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Securities Exchanges</strong>: Such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, which establish and enforce rules for listed companies and exchange members</li>
                    <li><strong>Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</strong>: Regulates municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors</li>
                    <li><strong>Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)</strong>: Regulates options trading and exchange members</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Jurisdiction and Authority of SROs</h3>
                <p>SROs derive their authority from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires broker-dealers to be members of a registered SRO. Their jurisdiction typically includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Member firms and their associated persons</li>
                    <li>Trading activities on exchanges or in specific markets</li>
                    <li>Listing standards for securities (in the case of exchanges)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>While SROs have significant regulatory authority, they operate under SEC oversight. The SEC reviews and approves SRO rules, can abrogate or amend SRO rules, and can review SRO disciplinary actions.</p>

                <h3>State Regulators</h3>
                <p>State securities regulators enforce state securities laws, commonly known as "blue sky laws." These laws existed before federal securities regulation and continue to play an important role in investor protection. State regulators typically:</p>

                <h3>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</h3>
                <p>The FDIC insures deposits in banks and savings associations. While primarily focused on banking, the FDIC affects the securities industry by:</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct Answer: D. Guarantee investment returns</strong></p>
                        <p>Explanation: The SEC's three-part mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. The SEC does not guarantee investment returns; in fact, all investments involve risk, and the SEC's role is to ensure proper disclosure of those risks, not to eliminate them.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Approving registration statements for new securities offerings</strong></p>
                        <p>Explanation: Approving registration statements for new securities offerings is a responsibility of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, not FINRA. FINRA is responsible for registering and examining broker-dealers, administering qualification examinations, and operating the CRD system, among other functions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. SROs operate under SEC oversight, with the SEC reviewing and approving SRO rules</strong></p>
                        <p>Explanation: SROs like FINRA operate under SEC oversight. The SEC reviews and approves SRO rules, can abrogate or amend SRO rules, and can review SRO disciplinary actions. SROs are not divisions of the SEC but separate entities with delegated regulatory authority.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Return of customer cash and securities when a broker-dealer fails</strong></p>
                        <p>Explanation: SIPC protects customers of failed broker-dealers by returning their cash and securities, up to $500,000 per customer (including up to $250,000 for cash). SIPC does not protect against market losses, unsuitable investments, or fraud. It only protects against the failure of a broker-dealer.</p>

                        <p>Explanation: A firm that acts as both a broker (executing trades for customers as an agent) and a dealer (buying and selling securities from its own inventory as a principal) is called a broker-dealer. Most securities firms are registered as broker-dealers, allowing them to operate in both capacities.</p>
